# Overview

The main objective of the project is to bring the fruits of technology to the people like nannies and nurses whose livelihoods have been affected by the pandemic due to lack of demand and the social distancing and exclusion protocols. Our solution aims at removing these barriers so that the required resources are made available to them and they're able to practice their craft not worrying about their next client or a lack of demand.
