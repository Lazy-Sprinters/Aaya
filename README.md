# Problem Statement

Finding a good nanny or a qualified nurse is highly difficult and rare, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad etc with the ever-increasing demand but not a lot of regulated and organized supply of service. Add medical requirements to the list and it becomes practically impossible. 

Presently, there is no established system in place where nannies or nurses can offer their services safely, securely and easily and a lot of the time, word of mouth is the only way of setting up any sort of communication which sometimes can lead to unqualified people getting employed. 

# Proposed Solution

The main objective of the project is to bring the fruits of technology to the people like nannies and nurses whose livelihoods have been affected by the pandemic due to lack of demand and the social distancing and exclusion protocols. Our solution aims at removing these barriers so that the required resources are made available to them and they're able to practice their craft not worrying about their next client or a lack of demand.

# Modules

1. Registration Module for caretakers as well as clients with certain background checks for ensuring credibility.
2. Service Provider's Portal which will contain the Client Requests if their requirements match the provider's needs.
3. Client's Portal, which will show the nurses/nannies/caretakers which satisfy their requirements:
    a. We will show the details of the nurses if the qualifications of the nurses meet the client requirements.
    b. Services can booked on contract as well as on the go.
    c. Bookings will be done on an agreement basis.
    d. The client will have to provide basic amenities and other facilities if pre-decided as per the agreement.
4. A review and complain tab if the client faces negligent, rude or unbecoming behaviour.
5. SOS/Red Alert Module for caretakers in cases of emergencies.
